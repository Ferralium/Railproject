# Wissselstoring
Python program which aims to provide the most optimal solution to rail routing by way of algorithms and heuristics.

# Getting started:
To get started, some actions are required. First, a couple of packages are required for the visualisation and output module
"""
pip install -r requirements.txt
"""

# Requirements:
To be able to run the program, it is required to supply the map- and connection data in a seperate folder called 'data/', which sits in the same folder as the main.py

Currently the main of this program only works with the ConnectiesHollandKlein.csv, while the visualisation module only works with StationsNationaal.csv and ConnectiesNationaal.csv. Please keep this in mind when running the code!

# Algorithms:
This program (will) run with different algorithms each providing convenient seperate output for comparison.
These algoirthms can be found in ...
